# Stock Price Forecasting
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using time series analysis. The primary model employed is ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and it forecasts future stock price movements based on historical data.

## Features
- **Stock Data Analysis:** Historical stock prices are analyzed.
- **ARIMA Model Implementation:** An ARIMA model is used for forecasting.
- **Visualization:** The notebook provides visualizations for:
  - Actual vs predicted stock prices.
  - Future forecasted prices.
  - Residuals (errors) of the model.
## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. **Data Loading:** The notebook requires historical stock price data. You can modify the data input to match your dataset.
2. **Model Training:** The ARIMA model is trained on the historical stock prices to predict future values.
3. **Visualization:** The results, including predictions and residuals, are visualized for better understanding.
## Visualizations
The notebook generates three key plots:

- Actual vs Predicted Stock Prices: A comparison of the modelâ€™s predictions with the actual data.
- Future Stock Price Forecast: A forecast for future stock prices based on the trained ARIMA model.
- Residuals: A plot of the residuals (errors) to assess model performance.
## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook.

```
jupyter notebook stock_price_forecasting.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells step by step to analyze stock data and forecast future prices.
